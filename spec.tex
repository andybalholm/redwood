\begin{abstract}

Redwood is an internet content-filtering program. 
It is designed to replace and improve on DansGuardian 
as the core of the Security Appliance internet filter. 
It adds flexibility and granularity to the filtering by classifying sites 
into multiple categories instead of just ``Allow'' and ``Block.'' 

\end{abstract}

\section{Basic Architecture}

Redwood runs as an ICAP server. This means that it runs in connection 
with a proxy server such as Squid, filtering HTTP requests and responses 
passed to it by the proxy.

Redwood examines each HTTP message to determine if it should be allowed to proceed. 
If so, it passes the message back to the proxy so that it can be forwarded 
to its final destination. If not, it replaces the message with a customizable page 
stating that the request is not allowed (optionally giving the reason 
and providing a link for filing an overblock request).

Redwood's filtering is based on URLs and also, where applicable, on page content. 
(By default, content filtering is applied to files whose MIME type starts with \verb"text".)

\section{Configuration File}

By default, the main configuration file is located at \verb"/etc/redwood/redwood.conf". 
This path can be changed by using the \verb"-c" command line switch. 
Configuration options may be specified either in the configuration file or as command-line
switches. In the configuration file, they may be specified either as
\verb"key = value" or as \verb"key value". Comments are delimited with \verb"#". 
Values may be enclosed in double quotes, with the usual backslash escapes.

An example configuration file:

\begin{verbatim}
# the template for the block page
blockpage "/etc/redwood/block.html"

# directory of static files to be served under http://gateway/
static-files-dir /etc/redwood/static

# directory of CGI scripts to run under http://gateway/
cgi-bin /etc/redwood/cgi

# the directory containing the category information
categories /etc/redwood/categories

# the minimum total score from all blocked categories needed 
# to block a page
threshold 275

# how many threads to run as on a multicore system
cores=4

# file configuring the content pruning
content-pruning /etc/redwood/pruning.conf

# path to the access log
access-log /var/log/redwood/access.log

# Customize which MIME types get filtered.
mime-allow text/css # Don't filter CSS files.
mime-filter application/javascript # Filter JS
mime-filter application/x-javascript
mime-filter application/json
mime-block video/x-ms-wmv # Block Windows Media Player video.
\end{verbatim}

\section{Categories}

The configuration files for Redwood allow the user to establish any number of categories 
corresponding to the types of content that he wishes to block or to allow. 
As each HTTP message is processed, it is assigned a score in each category, 
based on the filter lists that are set up for that category. 
These scores are then used to determine whether the page should be blocked.

Each category is a assigned an action: allow, block, or ignore. 
A page will be blocked if the score for any category listed as \verb"block" 
is higher than the highest score for any category listed as \verb"allow". 
If a category is listed as \verb"ignore", its score does not affect whether a page 
is blocked or not. (This is the default for a category that is not listed.) 
However, a page is not blocked unless the total score for all \verb"block" categories 
is greater than a certain configurable threshold. This prevents overblocks 
of pages with almost no textual content.

The categories are stored in a directory whose location is specified in the configuration file. 
Each subdirectory of that directory defines a category (with the same name as the directory). 

Each category's directory contains a file named \verb"category.conf" and any number of rule-list files. 
A category named ``mechanical'' might have a \verb"category.conf" file like the following:

\begin{verbatim}
description: Auto Repair
action: allow
\end{verbatim}

This configuration would mean that the category's user-visible description would be 
``Auto Repair'' rather than ``mechanical,'' and that pages that fall into the category would be allowed. 
The description defaults to the category name, and the action 
defaults to \verb"ignore". Actions can be overriden for specific users by the use of filter groups.

The rule-list files define the rules used to calculate the category's score. 
Each rule-list file must have an extension of \verb".list". 
(This rule ensures that files ending in \verb".bak", \verb".orig", etc. are ignored.) 
It is a plain-text file encoded in UTF-8. Comments are delimited with \verb"#". 
Here is an example of a rule-list file that might be in the directory for the 
``mechanical'' category mentioned earlier:

\begin{verbatim}
napaonline.com 200 # Give napaonline.com 200 points for this category.
www.napaonline.com/catalog/ 50 # bonus points for NAPA's catalog

default 150 # The following domains will each get 150 points.
carquest.com
autozone.com

/t[iy]re/ 75 # Any page with tire or tyre in the URL will get 75 points.
/parts/h 50 # A page with parts in the hostname will get 50 points

<grease gun> 25 # 25 points for each occurrence of "grease gun" in the content
<oil filter> 25 100 # 25 points for each occurrence, but no more than 100 total
\end{verbatim}

There are three kinds of filter rules:

\begin{description}

\item[URL matching] A URL matching rule consists of a domain name, optionally followed by a path. 
After it, separated by a space, is the weight---the number of points that get added to this category's score 
for sites that match the rule. 

If the rule consists of only a domain name (without a path),
it will also match subdomains: \verb"napaonline.com" also matches \verb"www.napaonline.com".
If there is a path, the domain must match exactly, but if the path ends with a slash,
it will also match longer paths: \verb"www.napaonline.com/catalog/" also matches 
\verb"www.napaonline.com/catalog/result.aspx".

If a domain and a subdomain (or a path and a subdirectory) 
are both listed, the subdomain will effectively get the sum of the two weights. For example, if \verb"xerox.com"
were listed with 100 points, and \verb"support.xerox.com" were listed with 50 points, \verb"support.xerox.com" 
would actually get a score of 150 points.

\item[URL regular expressions] A regular expression to match the URL is listed between slashes. 
The points are added to the category score for each page whose URL matches the regular expression. 
Regular expression matching is case-insensitive. The regular expression syntax is that supported by the RE2 library.

A regular expression can be restricted to matching a certain part of the URL by adding a one-character suffix
immediately after the final slash. A suffix of \verb"h" matches the hostname, \verb"p" matches the path,
and \verb"q" matches the query.

\item[Content phrases] Unlike the other two kinds of rules, these apply to the content of the page, not the URL. 
Phrases are enclosed between angle brackets. Before testing to see if a phrase matches, 
both the phrase and the page are simplified: capital letters are converted to lowercase, 
all characters that are not letters or digits are replaced by spaces,
and multiple spaces are replaced by single spaces. Then the phrase weight is added to the page's score for the category 
for each time the phrase is found on the page. But if the phrase has a second weight listed, 
no more than that amount will be added no matter how many times the phrase occurs. 
(In the example, if ``oil filter'' occurred more than four times, the additional occurrences wouldn't count.)

\end{description}

There is also a \verb"default" rule. It specifies what weight will be assigned to rules that don't specify a weight. 
It applies to all rules without a specified weight between it and the next \verb"default" rule or the end of the file. 
If there is no \verb"default" rule, the default weight is zero.

Weights must be integers, but they may be negative. Negative weights can be used to offset short, general matches 
with long, more-specific ones, e.g.:

\begin{verbatim}
<grease> 10
<grease paint> -10
\end{verbatim}

If a page is blocked based on its URL (i.e. by URL matching and/or URL regular expressions), 
its content will not be evaluated because the page will not be downloaded.

\section{Content Pruning}

Between downloading a page and scanning its content for phrases, 
Redwood can perform ``content pruning.'' 
This is scanning the parsed HTML tree for elements matching certain criteria,
and deleting those elements and their children.

Content pruning is controlled by a configuration file.
Each line of the file contains a URL-matching or URL-regular-expression rule
to specify what site or page the pruning applies to, 
and a CSS selector to specify what elements to delete.

\begin{verbatim}
# Craigslist personals and discussion forums
craigslist.org div#ppp, div#forums, option[value=ppp]

# Bing ad sidebar
bing.com div.sb_adsNv2
\end{verbatim}

\section{Test Mode}

If Redwood is run with the \verb"-test" switch, it does not run as an ICAP server. 
Instead, it evaluates the URL given as an argument after the switch.
It prints detailed debugging information about how the URL and its content would be rated
if that page were requested in normal operation: how many times each rule matches, 
what the score is in each category, which categories would block the page, etc.

\section{Log Files}

Redwood has two categories of messages that can be logged:
general diagnostic messages, and a record of ICAP requests processed (called the access log).
The general diagnostic messages are sent to standard error by default,
and may be redirected to a file using normal shell redirection.
The access log is in CSV format, 
and goes to standard output by default.
It can be sent to a file by including the \verb"access-log" directive in Redwood's configuration file.

The access log has the following fields: time, username or IP address, 
action (allow, block, or ignore), URL, ICAP mode (REQMOD [request] or RESPMOD [response]), 
content type, whether the content was modified by Redwood, which rules matched (and how many times), 
the score for each category, and the list of categories that caused the page to be blocked (if it was).
